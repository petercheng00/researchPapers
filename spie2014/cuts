major cuts
shortest path texturing intro

NEED TO DO:
runtime is kinda dumb right now


current initiative
existing research -> remove lame stuff. add stuff about lining up to geometry

potential cuts
remove background info 
remove k-d things...just say surface
existing implementations
direct tile thing
line matching is pretty verbose
occlusion is pretty simple to explain
shortest path texturing, operator is bent forwards...no longer that meaningful since we have high res models
explain dag general form quicker
examples: don't really care about how geometry generation works
