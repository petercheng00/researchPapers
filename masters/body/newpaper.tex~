%  Article to demonstrate format for SPIE Proceedings
%  Special instructions are included in this file after the

%  Numerous commands are commented out, but included to show how
%  to effect various options, e.g., to print page numbers, etc.
%  This LaTeX source file is composed for LaTeX2e.

%  The following commands have been added in the SPIE class 
%  file (spie.cls) and will not be understood in other classes:
%  \supit{}, \authorinfo{}, \skiplinehalf, \keywords{}
%  The bibliography style file is called spiebib.bst, 
%  which replaces the standard style unstr.bst.  

\documentclass[]{spie}  %>>> use for US letter paper
%%\documentclass[a4paper]{spie}  %>>> use this instead for A4 paper
%%\documentclass[nocompress]{spie}  %>>> to avoid compression of citations
%% \addtolength{\voffset}{9mm}   %>>> moves text field down
%% \renewcommand{\baselinestretch}{1.65}   %>>> 1.65 for double spacing, 1.25 for 1.5 spacing 
%  The following command loads a graphics package to include images 
%  in the document. It may be necessary to specify a DVI driver option,
%  e.g., [dvips], but that may be inappropriate for some LaTeX 
%  installations. 
\usepackage{graphicx}
\usepackage{subfig}

\title{Texture mapping 3D planar models of indoor environments with noisy camera poses} 

%>>>> The author is responsible for formatting the 
%  author list and their institutions.  Use  \skiplinehalf 
%  to separate author list from addresses and between each address.
%  The correspondence between each author and his/her address
%  can be indicated with a superscript in italics, 
%  which is easily obtained with \supit{}.

\begin{abstract}
  Automated 3D modeling of building interiors is used in applications
  such as virtual reality and environment mapping. Texturing these
  models allows for photorealistic visualizations of the data
  collected by such modeling systems. Camera poses obtained by these
  systems and used for texturing often suffer from inaccuracies
  however, resulting in visible discontinuities when successive images
  are projected onto a surface for texturing. Existing methods to
  stitch images together are often computationally expensive and work
  independently of pose estimates and geometry information. We propose
  an efficient method to refine camera poses in 2D using both existing
  estimates and geometry information, followed by two different
  methods to composite images together, based on the geometry of
  surfaces being textured. The effectiveness of our methods is
  demonstrated on a number of different indoor environments.
