\message{ !name(paper.tex)}%  article.tex (Version 3.3, released 19 January 2008)
%  Article to demonstrate format for SPIE Proceedings
%  Special instructions are included in this file after the
%  symbol %>>>>
%  Numerous commands are commented out, but included to show how
%  to effect various options, e.g., to print page numbers, etc.
%  This LaTeX source file is composed for LaTeX2e.

%  The following commands have been added in the SPIE class 
%  file (spie.cls) and will not be understood in other classes:
%  \supit{}, \authorinfo{}, \skiplinehalf, \keywords{}
%  The bibliography style file is called spiebib.bst, 
%  which replaces the standard style unstr.bst.  

\documentclass[]{spie}  %>>> use for US letter paper
%%\documentclass[a4paper]{spie}  %>>> use this instead for A4 paper
%%\documentclass[nocompress]{spie}  %>>> to avoid compression of citations
%% \addtolength{\voffset}{9mm}   %>>> moves text field down
%% \renewcommand{\baselinestretch}{1.65}   %>>> 1.65 for double spacing, 1.25 for 1.5 spacing 
%  The following command loads a graphics package to include images 
%  in the document. It may be necessary to specify a DVI driver option,
%  e.g., [dvips], but that may be inappropriate for some LaTeX 
%  installations. 
\usepackage[]{graphicx}

\title{Texture mapping 3D planar models of indoor environments with noisy camera poses} 

%>>>> The author is responsible for formatting the 
%  author list and their institutions.  Use  \skiplinehalf 
%  to separate author list from addresses and between each address.
%  The correspondence between each author and his/her address
%  can be indicated with a superscript in italics, 
%  which is easily obtained with \supit{}.

\author{Peter Cheng, Michael Anderson, Stewart He, Avideh Zakhor
\skiplinehalf
University of California, Berkeley ; \\

%>>>> Further information about the authors, other than their 
%  institution and addresses, should be included as a footnote, 
%  which is facilitated by the \authorinfo{} command.

\authorinfo{Further author information: (Send correspondence to A.A.A.)\\A.A.A.: E-mail: aaa@tbk2.edu, Telephone: 1 505 123 1234\\  B.B.A.: E-mail: bba@cmp.com, Telephone: +33 (0)1 98 76 54 32}
