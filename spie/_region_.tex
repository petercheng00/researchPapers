%  The following command loads a graphics package to include images

\subsection{Blending}
\label{sec:blending}
We now apply the same blending process to the two texturing methods:
tile caching or seam minimization.

Although the image alignment steps and image selection in both methods
attempt to minimize all mismatches between images, there are
occasional unavoidable discontinuities in the final texture due to
different lighting conditions or inaccuracies in planar geometry or
projection. These can however be treated and smoothed over by applying
alpha blending over image seams.  Whether the units we are blending
are rectangularly-cropped images or rectangular tiles, we can apply
the same blending procedure, as long as we have a guaranteed overlap
between units to blend over.

For the tile caching method, we can ensure overlap by texturing a
larger tile than needed for display. For example, for a rendered tile
$l_1 \times l_1$, we can associate it with a texture $(l_1 + l_2)
\times (l_1 + l_2)$ in size. We have found $l_2 = \frac{l_1}{2}$ to provide a
good amount of blending without blurring features. For the seam
minimization method, we have already ensured overlap between
images. To enforce consistent blending however, we add a minimum
required overlap distance while solving the shortest path problem in
Section \ref{sec:seamMinimization}. Additionally, if images overlap in
a region greater than the overlap distance, we only apply blending
over an area equal to the overlap distance.

After blending pixels linearly across overlapping regions using alpha
blending, texture mapping is complete. Figures \ref{fig:compareAll}(e)
and \ref{fig:compareAll}(f) show the blended versions of Figures
\ref{fig:compareAll}(c) and \ref{fig:compareAll}(d) respectively. It
is clear that the seam minimization approach still exhibits better
alignment and fewer seams than the tile-caching method, as Figure
\ref{fig:compareAll}(f) has the best visual quality among the textures
in Figure \ref{fig:compareAll}.
