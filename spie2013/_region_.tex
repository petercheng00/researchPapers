%  Numerous commands are commented out, but included to show how

%  This LaTeX source file is composed for LaTeX2e.

%  The following commands have been added in the SPIE class 
%  file (spie.cls) and will not be understood in other classes:
%  \supit{}, \authorinfo{}, \skiplinehalf, \keywords{}
%  The bibliography style file is called spiebib.bst, 
%  which replaces the standard style unstr.bst.  

\documentclass[]{spie}  %>>> use for US letter paper

%%\documentclass[nocompress]{spie}  %>>> to avoid compression of citations
%% \addtolength{\voffset}{9mm}   %>>> moves text field down
%% \renewcommand{\baselinestretch}{1.65}   %>>> 1.65 for double spacing, 1.25 for 1.5 spacing 
%  The following command loads a graphics package to include images

  \caption{(a) The image from the camera in this diagram contains
    texture that belongs to the grey occluding surface, which should
    not be projected onto the orange target surface; (b) without
    geometry alignment, texture to the left of the red line would be
    removed, which would leave some erroneous texture projected onto
    our target surface; (c) after geometry alignment, the image is
    shifted, resulting in the correct amount of texture being
    removed.}

In order to correctly texture surfaces, it is important to detect and
remove parts of image projections containing texture for occluding
surfaces. For instance, in Figure \ref{fig:occlusion}(a), an image
used to texture the orange target surface also contains part of a grey
occluding surface. We remove this incorrect texture by recursively
performing ray-polygon intersection tests between the camera location
and other surfaces \cite{rayintersection}. These intersection tests
are performed at the corners of a grid overlaid upon the target
surface. Where all four corners of a grid section are occluded,
texture is removed. Where one or more corners are occluded, the grid
is subdivided into four, and the process repeats. Occlusion checking
works entirely with geometry, so by ensuring that images match
geometry using \ref{sec:geometryAlignment}'s alignment procedure,
texture belonging to other surfaces is accurately removed, as seen in
Figure \ref{fig:occlusion}(b).
